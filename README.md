## 1. Introduction to React  
- **What is React?**  
  React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows you to create reusable UI components and manage complex UIs efficiently.  

- **Why React?**  
  - Declarative approach to building UIs  
  - Component-based architecture  
  - Fast rendering with a virtual DOM  
  - Large ecosystem and community support

## 2. Fundamentals of React  

### 2.1 JSX (JavaScript XML)  
- Learn how to write HTML-like syntax in JavaScript using JSX.  
- Understand embedding JavaScript expressions in JSX.  

### 2.2 Components  
- Understand the difference between functional and class components.  
- Learn how to create and render components.  
- Pass data to components using props.  

### 2.3 State Management  
- Manage dynamic data within components using `useState`.  
- Learn the difference between stateful and stateless components.  

### 2.4 Events in React  
- Handle events like clicks, form submissions, and more.  
- Understand event binding and passing parameters to event handlers.  

### 2.5 Conditional Rendering  
- Render components or elements conditionally using `if`, ternary operators, and logical `&&`.  

### 2.6 Lists and Keys  
- Use the `.map()` function to render dynamic lists.  
- Understand the importance of unique keys in lists for efficient rendering.

## 3. Intermediate React Concepts  

### 3.1 Lifecycle Methods (Class Components)  
- Understand mounting, updating, and unmounting phases.  
- Learn methods like `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount`.  

### 3.2 React Hooks  
- **`useState`**: Manage component state.  
- **`useEffect`**: Handle side effects like API calls or subscriptions.  
- **`useRef`**: Access and manipulate DOM elements.  
- **`useMemo`** and **`useCallback`**: Optimize performance by memoizing expensive computations.  
- **`useReducer`**: Manage more complex state logic.  

### 3.3 Forms and Form Handling  
- Work with controlled and uncontrolled components.  
- Implement form validation to handle user inputs effectively.  

### 3.4 Styling in React  
- Explore different ways to style your components:  
  - Inline styles  
  - CSS modules  
  - Styled-components  
  - Tailwind CSS  

### 3.5 Routing with React Router  
- Learn how to navigate between pages using React Router.  
- Implement dynamic routes, nested routes, and redirects.  

### 3.6 Error Handling  
- Implement error boundaries to gracefully handle component errors.  
- Handle async errors when working with APIs or other asynchronous processes.

## 4. Ecosystem and Tooling  

### 4.1 Working with APIs  
- Fetch data using `fetch` and `axios`.  
- Consume REST and GraphQL APIs.  
- Handle loading states, error states, and responses.  

### 4.2 Testing in React  
- Write unit tests using Jest and React Testing Library.  
- Perform end-to-end testing with Cypress.  

### 4.3 TypeScript with React  
- Understand the basics of TypeScript and why it’s beneficial.  
- Add type-checking for props, state, and components.  
- Use interfaces and types to improve code quality.  

### 4.4 Build Tools  
- Learn about bundlers like Webpack and Babel.  
- Use Create React App (CRA) to quickly set up a React project.  
- Explore alternative build tools like Vite for faster development.
