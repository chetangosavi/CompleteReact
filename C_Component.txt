Component:
    - A React component is a reusable piece of code that creates a part of a user interface (UI). 
      Components are the fundamental building blocks of a React app. 
    - Component is nothing but a function

Types of Component :

        1. functional Component:
            - Functional components are simpler and preferred for most use cases. They are JavaScript functions 
              that return React elements. With the introduction of React Hooks, functional components can also 
              manage state and lifecycle events
        Syntax :

            const ComponentName = (props) => {
                return (
                    <div>
                        some code ......
                    </div>
                );
            }
            export default ComponentName;

        2. class Components:
           - Class components are ES6 classes that extend React.Component. They include additional features like 
             state management and lifecycle methods.

                - State Management: State is managed using the this.state property.
                - Lifecycle Methods: Includes methods like componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, etc.
        Syntx :

            class Greet extends React.Component {
                render() {
                    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}!</h1>;
                }
            }
