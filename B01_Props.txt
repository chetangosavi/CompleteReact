Props:
    In JavaScript, especially in the context of React, props (short for properties) are a way to pass data 
    from one component to another. They allow you to make components reusable and dynamic by enabling customization 
    through external input.

    - from Parent to child component only(one way data Binding)
    
    const Comp = (props)=>{
        console.log(props) --> returns an object
    }

    Accessing Props:
            supp - props{
                id:1,
                name:"chetan",
                city:"Pune"
            }

            conosle.log({props.name})

spread operator:
    The spread operator (...) in JavaScript is a convenient syntax to expand elements of an iterable 
    (like an array, string, Map, or Set) or object properties into individual elements. Itâ€™s commonly 
    used for copying, merging, and passing data in a concise and readable way

    spread operator only works on iterable or shows error

    Object.entries(prop) --> Converts each entry into seperate Array
