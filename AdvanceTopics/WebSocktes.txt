WebSocket:
    - WebSocket is a computer cummunication protocol providing full duplex communication channel over a single
      TCP connection
    - The socket protocol was standardized by the IETF as RFC 6455 in 2011

Key Features of WebSockets:
    - Full-Duplex Communication: Both the client and the server can send and receive messages independently of 
      each other, unlike HTTP, where the client must always initiate a request.
    - Persistent Connection: Once established, the connection remains open, reducing the overhead of 
      repeated HTTP requests and responses.
    - Real-Time Updates: Ideal for scenarios that require instant updates, such as chat apps, stock 
      price tickers, online gaming, and collaborative tools.

How It Works:
    - Handshake: The WebSocket protocol starts with an HTTP request from the client to the server to establish 
      the connection. If the server accepts, the protocol switches from HTTP to WebSocket.(UPGRADE)
    - Communication: After the handshake, the connection is established, and both parties can exchange 
      messages in real time using a lightweight format (usually JSON or binary data).
    - Closure: Either the client or server can close the connection when it's no longer needed.
